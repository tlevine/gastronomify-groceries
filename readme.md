Gastronomify
=====

We can order food from Safeway, though their website isn't great.
Here are some notes on that.

As a start for gastronomification, we might try fancy fruit juices
because their identification codes are less likely to change over time.
Here are some helpful URLs on that front.

Some obvious variables are here.

* Brand
* Fruit
* Size of bottle
* Number of bottles ordered
